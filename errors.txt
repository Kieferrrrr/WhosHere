WhosHere Error Message Information
----------------------------------

"CTRL+C pressed"
    You pressed CTRL and C at the same time lol

"Cannot import WhosHere.py as a module"
    WhosHere.py is intended to be used as a programme itself you canno import it

"Operating system could not be defined"
    Your operating system is likely not Windows or a common Linux distro you are
    likely using something such as FreeBSD which wouldnt have been caught, this 
    should not cause too much issue when running WhosHere but if it does it will
    likely be SSID and interface resolving problems which are not fatal and can 
    be fixed by defining a set interface in config.ini

"Failed to find config.ini"
    config.ini is expected to be in the same directory as the WhosHere.py file 
    however it is not, move config.ini back to the script directory or re clone
    from github

"Failed to find or use value in config.ini"
    A value in config.ini is unusable or missing, check the values you have set
    in config.ini or revert the file back to the default from github

"Unkown"
    This error will show in the place of an SSID or hostname if it cannot be found,
    as a hostname this will likely pose no issue and not be an issue however when it
    appears for an SSID you will likely then face an interface issue fixable by 
    specifying an interface in config.ini

"Interface could not be used"
    You have either chosen an interface in config.ini that could not be used or the 
    default wireless interface could not be used, simplest fix is to choose another
    interface in config.ini which is funtional
